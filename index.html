			<h1>Brandon Huffman</h1>
			<p class="text-indent">Brandon Huffman comes from a mixed background. Growing up he spent countless hours playing computer games,
				but when going to college tried a variety of other interests before finally settling on a double major in
				Economics and Political Science. The usual route for such degrees is either Masters School for Economics or
				going to Law School. Too broke for Masters School and not wanting to become a blood sucking lawyer, Brandon
				opted to pursue a career in Accounting which is related to both Econ and Poli Sci. After getting an
				accounting certificate from CNM Brandon spent some time in that before deciding to pursue something just a little more interesting .
				So he dove head first into the Deep Dive program, returning back to his first love, computers. <div class="heart">&#x2665;</div>
			</p>
			<p class="text-indent">If you couldn't guess Brandon loves learning and being a total geek.
				As such he likes to spend his free time conquering empires on Civilization, taming space monsters on Masters
				of Orion, and negotiating peace treaties with Klingons on Star Trek Online. An avid believer in the
				exponential potential of computers, Brandon is excited to be in a field that is on the cutting edge of
				technology and is driving us into the future.
